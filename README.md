## Description

Run the title or description text of your Youtube video through the list to better anticipate demonetization before uploading.

### Important notes about the ***Youtube Demonetization Words*** List:
- Capitalization has no effect on monetization status
- This list is being updated periodically, and will change over time
- Some results are outdated, and might be inaccurate
- These results were tested in titles only. Descriptions and tags are less strict
- dashes (-) act the same way as spaces in compound words

The original list project is available here:

# Note 
to update the wordlist, simply remove the wordlist.csv and wordlist_clean and rerun the program.
<code>rm wordlist*</code>
